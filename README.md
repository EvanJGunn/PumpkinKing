# Pumpkin King Mod Readme

Pumpkin King is a spooky minecraft mod (1.7.10) that will add game elements to
allow for an among us, project winter, and dead by daylight style gameplay.

Some new features this mod will allow for are:
* Traps
* Cooperative Objectives
* Stage Based Gameplay
* Shops
* The Pumpkin King Game Mode (Which utilizes the above features)

Notably all of these features are likely achievable in vanilla 1.7.10 will
good command block usage. In this case we felt that the jank, and associated redstone
engineering would be more time-consuming than simply implementing the game mode
from scratch in java.
